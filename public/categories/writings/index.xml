      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is a short story I wrote in the Fall of 2023 for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.swarthmorereview.com/posts/11-01-tiny-ghost-stories&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tiny Ghost Stories&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; contest of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.swarthmorereview.com/&#34;&gt;Review&lt;/a&gt;, one of Swarthmore College&amp;rsquo;s student-run literary magazines. The story did not end up getting published because of mismanagement of the contest by those running it—but nonetheless I enjoyed the process of writing and drafting this short narrative. Although short (&lt;em&gt;required less than 300 words&lt;/em&gt;), the word choice and composition conjures up some visceral imagery for the reader to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to find out after writing this piece that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; in fact an actual &amp;ldquo;Curse of the Colnel&amp;rdquo; which is attested to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Colonel&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is a Japanese urban legend that posits that due to the mistreatment of a KFC Colnel Sanders statue during the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Japan_Series&#34;&gt;1985 Japan Series&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanshin_Tigers&#34;&gt;Japanese Hanshin Tigers&lt;/a&gt; baseball team was cursed by the ghost of Mr. Sanders. This event preceded a long 18-year losing streak. The statue itself was thrown into the Dōtonbori river in Ōsaka, Japan during a commmotion following a surprise victory against their opponents that night. It has since been recovered from the river and is now proudly on display at KFC headquarters in Yokohama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;curse_of_the_colnel&#34;&gt;CURSE_OF_THE_COLNEL &lt;a href=&#34;#curse_of_the_colnel&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;ye beguiled by the purveyor of KFC® 8-Piece Fried Chicken Bucket®; Consume its contents within a period of 10 days. If this is not done, in the invocation of Cōlon’nel Sāląndærsth™ from beyond your greasy receptacle, with each passing moon will come tandem with the breaking the seal of one of 3 individual curses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPON the 11th DAY: The Bucket® shall convulse, letting loose muffled shrill, monkey-like cackling, and the occasional awry grin may be seen plastered upon the face of The Cōlon’nel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPON the 12th DAY: The Bucket® become an earthenware vessel and emit dark smoke upon approach. When beyond sight, it chatter in haunting melody: the secrets of 11 Herbs and Spices®. DISTURBED, yet pose no PERIL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPON the 13th, and FINAL DAY: The Bucket® become an sinister visage UNFIT for the eyes of. Staring over 12 minute(s), WILL drive interlocutevr mad with unknowable insights. Rapid emulsion of black pestilence makes sensation akin to „超先験;’भगवान्हस्त』when 目beholden, The Bvcket®, NOW of fleshy, odiovs constitvtion; grossly vrinate, sings the hymn of herbs, cries, and becoming rapturovs. Within the bvcket reveals genvine THAT vnsightly form: THAT loathsome fungal如 lapping CAKES: “شبحPHANTASMAL EYES on the BRAIN的INSIDE.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WE ALL WITNESSED.&lt;/p&gt;
