      <description>&lt;p&gt;What we will be looking at today is [aiko -『花火』](&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqGHxcTPRfI&amp;amp;ab_channel=aikoOfficial&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqGHxcTPRfI&amp;amp;ab_channel=aikoOfficial&lt;/a&gt;)and in this one we have a really hardcosre Y2K aestehic which really dominates much of the video itself. This is the first song that I have encountered of Aiko, and while I don&amp;rsquo;t know how indicitive it is of her entire style as an artist, but I will say that I enjoyed the song itself. I found that it has a really jumpy and sort of exciting feel to it, that I think is somewhat encountered in other artists similar to aiko. I would that that those which somewhat are close to aiko in their style would be mei ehara, or maybe Lovely Sumemr Chan, although these are not entirely set. I think that there are likely others as well, I will do a quick search on spoti-stats to try and get a better idea of what to think.&lt;/p&gt;
