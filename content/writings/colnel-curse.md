The following is a short story I wrote in the Fall of 2023 for the ["Tiny Ghost Stories"](https://www.swarthmorereview.com/posts/11-01-tiny-ghost-stories) contest of the [Review](https://www.swarthmorereview.com/), one of Swarthmore College's student-run literary magazines. The story did not end up getting published because of mismanagement of the contest by those running it—but nonetheless I enjoyed the process of writing and drafting this short narrative. Although short (_required less than 300 words_), the word choice and composition conjures up some visceral imagery for the reader to enjoy.

I came to find out after writing this piece that there _is_ in fact an actual "Curse of the Colnel" which is attested to [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Colonel). It is a Japanese urban legend that posits that due to the mistreatment of a KFC Colnel Sanders statue during the [1985 Japan Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Japan_Series) the [Japanese Hanshin Tigers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanshin_Tigers) baseball team was cursed by the ghost of Mr. Sanders. This event preceded a long 18-year losing streak. The statue itself was thrown into the Dōtonbori river in Ōsaka, Japan during a commmotion following a surprise victory against their opponents that night. It has since been recovered from the river and is now proudly on display at KFC headquarters in Yokohama.

# CURSE_OF_THE_COLNEL

ye beguiled by the purveyor of KFC® 8-Piece Fried Chicken Bucket®; Consume its contents within a period of 10 days. If this is not done, in the invocation of Cōlon’nel Sāląndærsth™ from beyond your greasy receptacle, with each passing moon will come tandem with the breaking the seal of one of 3 individual curses.

UPON the 11th DAY: The Bucket® shall convulse, letting loose muffled shrill, monkey-like cackling, and the occasional awry grin may be seen plastered upon the face of The Cōlon’nel.

UPON the 12th DAY: The Bucket® become an earthenware vessel and emit dark smoke upon approach. When beyond sight, it chatter in haunting melody: the secrets of 11 Herbs and Spices®. DISTURBED, yet pose no PERIL.

UPON the 13th, and FINAL DAY: The Bucket® become an sinister visage UNFIT for the eyes of. Staring over 12 minute(s), WILL drive interlocutevr mad with unknowable insights. Rapid emulsion of black pestilence makes sensation akin to „超先験;’भगवान्हस्त』when 目beholden, The Bvcket®, NOW of fleshy, odiovs constitvtion; grossly vrinate, sings the hymn of herbs, cries, and becoming rapturovs. Within the bvcket reveals genvine THAT vnsightly form: THAT loathsome fungal如 lapping CAKES: “شبحPHANTASMAL EYES on the BRAIN的INSIDE.”

WE ALL WITNESSED.
