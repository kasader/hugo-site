What we will be looking at today is [aiko -『花火』](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqGHxcTPRfI&ab_channel=aikoOfficial\)and in this one we have a really hardcosre Y2K aestehic which really dominates much of the video itself. This is the first song that I have encountered of Aiko, and while I don't know how indicitive it is of her entire style as an artist, but I will say that I enjoyed the song itself. I found that it has a really jumpy and sort of exciting feel to it, that I think is somewhat encountered in other artists similar to aiko. I would that that those which somewhat are close to aiko in their style would be mei ehara, or maybe Lovely Sumemr Chan, although these are not entirely set. I think that there are likely others as well, I will do a quick search on spoti-stats to try and get a better idea of what to think.
