Hi. I am Sasha Casada, a GO developer/software engineer for [Diarkis](https://diarkis.io/), currently located in Tokyo, Japan. I attended [Swarthmore College '24](https://www.swarthmore.edu/), double majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.swarthmore.edu/computer-science) and [Japanese](https://www.swarthmore.edu/japanese).

# About Me

I have a wide swath of educational interests that I hope to write about using this blog. I enjoy: [Computing](/tags/computing), [Communications Engineering](/tags/engineering), [Electrical Engineering](/tags/engineering), [Historical Linguistics](/tags/historical-linguistics), as well as [Literary](/tags/literature) and [Historical Studies](/tags/history).

I myself mostly enjoy building things (currently only programming), learning, and optimizing my life. By day I am a GO developer for a network engineering start-up in Tokyo, and in my free time I tinker with systems and write about web development, programming languages, and configurable systems. My current intrests include Operating Systems, Parallel and Distributed Computing, Networking, Security and Privacy, and Compilers.

There's a lot here, so thanks for stopping by!
